Fenwick Tree, also known as Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that efficiently supports two operations on an array of numbers:

Update: Modify the value of an element in the array.
Query: Calculate the prefix sum of a prefix of the array.
The key idea behind Fenwick Tree is to represent the array in a binary tree-like structure, where each node stores the cumulative sum of a range of elements in the array. Specifically, each node i in the Fenwick Tree represents the sum of elements in the range [i - 2^r + 1, i], where r is the position of the least significant set bit in the binary representation of i.

The operations are performed as follows:

Update Operation:

To update the value of an element at index i in the array, we traverse the Fenwick Tree, updating the nodes whose ranges cover index i.
We can efficiently find the next node to update by adding the least significant set bit to i (obtained using bitwise AND with the two's complement of i).
We continue this process until we reach the end of the Fenwick Tree.
Query Operation:

To calculate the prefix sum up to index i in the array, we traverse the Fenwick Tree, summing up the values of nodes whose ranges cover index i.
We can efficiently find the next node to include in the sum by subtracting the least significant set bit from i (obtained using bitwise AND with the two's complement of i).
We continue this process until we reach the root of the Fenwick Tree.
The advantage of Fenwick Tree is that both update and query operations have time complexity of O(log N), where N is the size of the input array. This makes it particularly efficient for problems that involve frequent updates and prefix sum calculations. Additionally, Fenwick Tree requires only O(N) space, which is significantly less than other data structures like segment trees.

fenwick tree vs segment tree

Fenwick trees (also known as Binary Indexed Trees) and Segment trees are both data structures used for efficient range queries and updates in an array. However, they have different characteristics and are suited for different scenarios.

Here's a brief comparison between Fenwick trees and Segment trees:

Construction Time:

Fenwick Tree: The construction time complexity of a Fenwick tree is O(n * log n), where n is the size of the input array.
Segment Tree: The construction time complexity of a Segment tree is O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
Space Complexity:

Fenwick Tree: Fenwick trees use O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.
Segment Tree: Segment trees use O(4n) space, where n is the size of the input array.
Updates:

Fenwick Tree: Fenwick trees support efficient updates in O(log n) time complexity.
Segment Tree: Segment trees also support efficient updates in O(log n) time complexity.
Queries:

Fenwick Tree: Fenwick trees support efficient prefix sum queries in O(log n) time complexity.
Segment Tree: Segment trees support a wider range of queries, including range sum, range minimum/maximum queries, etc., in O(log n) time complexity.
Suitability:

Fenwick Tree: Fenwick trees are simpler to implement and are usually preferred when the range queries are limited to prefix sums or single updates.
Segment Tree: Segment trees are more versatile and can handle a wider range of queries efficiently, making them suitable for more complex scenarios.
In summary, Fenwick trees are lightweight and efficient for certain types of queries like prefix sums, while Segment trees provide more flexibility and can handle a broader range of queries at the cost of slightly higher space complexity and construction time. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your problem and the trade-offs you are willing to make.
